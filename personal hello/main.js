// Part II: Personal Hello
// -----------
// - Create a blank, valid HTML5 document
// - Create a javascript file and include it with a script tag as before
// - Use var, prompt, string literals, the + operator, and alert such that when the user opens the page, it will ask them for their name, and then respond with "Hello [YOUR_NAME]!"
var YOUR_NAME=prompt('What is your name?')

alert("Hello " + YOUR_NAME + "!")
